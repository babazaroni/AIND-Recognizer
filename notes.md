## Probabilities

Conditional probabilites: use | as in P(X|Y)

Joint Probabilites: use ,  as in P(X,Y)

complementary probability P(A) = p &rArr; P(&not;A) = 1 - p

independence X &perp; Y : Product of Marginals P(x)P(Y) = joint probability P(X,Y) 

dependence P(X<sub>2</sub> = Heads | X<sub>1</sub> = Heads) probability X<sub>2</sub> is heads given X<sub>1</sub> is heads

total probability P(Y) = &sum; P(Y|X = *i*)P(X = *i*)

P(&not;X|Y) = 1 - P(X|Y)

## Bayes Rule

P(X|Y) = P(Y|X)(P(X)/P(Y) or  Posterior =  Likelyhood * Prior / Marginal Likelyhood

P(B) often expanded to &sum; P(B|A=a)P(A=a)
